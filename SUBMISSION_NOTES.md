```

### **Required Indexes**
- `messages`: `deliveryStatus` (Ascending), `timestamp` (Descending)
- `chats`: `participants` (Arrays), `lastMessageAt` (Descending)
- `proactiveSuggestions`: `chatId` (Ascending), `actedOn` (Ascending), `dismissed` (Ascending)

### **Collections Structure**
- `users`: User profiles and authentication data
- `chats`: Chat metadata and participant information
